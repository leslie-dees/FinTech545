# FinTech545
All of the methods used for project testing are contained inside fin_package.py

Descriptions of inputs, internal methods, and outputs are listed where necessary inside of methods. This package is imported into Project folders for Week0X, and will be moving forward.

In order to recreate code, all you need to do is follow the comments for the question that each line is answering and uncomment the line of python code if it is commented out. If the code pauses after a plot is created, close out of the plot and the code will continue to run.
